# Ninja Chat Android App Privacy Policy

Ninja DevOps built the Ninja Chat app as an Open Source app. The Ninja Chat Android App App and the ninja.chat XMPP Server are provided by Ninja DevOps at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Ninja Chat unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Contacts, Messages, Avatar Picture, Log Data, Username, and OMEMO Public Keys. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.

Ninja DevOps or its developers don’t have control over the data you send through the app. However the following data might get uploaded to your XMPP provider:

#### Data uploaded to your XMPP provider
 * Messages. This includes text messages, images and other files
 * Your avatar / profile picture
 * Your public keys for the OMEMO encryption
 * Your username and password hash
#### What does not get uploaded
 * The contacts from your phone’s address book. Ninja Chat only asks permissions to read your contacts to show the profile pictures and names of the corresponding XMPP contacts. Your contacts are never published anywhere. If you opt-out of this permission Ninja Chat will work just fine.

Using the ninja.chat XMPP provider is optional. Ninja Chat will connect to almost any other XMPP provider.

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app

*   [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
*   [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics)
*   [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/)

If you installed this app from the Google Play store then Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics information is stored in Google Firebase. This data is anonoymous
but data related to app crashes and general app usage is set to Google Firebase to improve the stability and functionality of this app. This data is not sold
or provided to any other 3rd party entities by Ninja DevOps or its developers.

## Using the ninja.chat provider
In the Ninja Chat Android app there is an option to use the default provider of ninja.chat. If you use this ninja.chat default XMPP server then this section applies to you.

#### What we store
 * Account data
    * Your user name and hash of your password
    * The date of your account creation.
 * Messages
    * Offline messages. If someone sends you a message while you are offline that message will be stored until you get back online.
    * Archive. By default we will be keeping an archive of your messages for later retrieval by yourself. This can come in handy if you log in with a new device and want access to your message history and is also required if you want to use the OMEMO encryption with multiple devices. You can opt-out of this by setting your server-side archiving preferences with your XMPP client.
    * Files. Every file you share with a contact or a conference will be uploaded and stored for later retrieval by the recipients.
 * Other data
    * A list of your contacts (Roster, Buddylist). This list is maintained by you. You decide who goes on that list and who gets deleted.
    * Semi public data you are publishing for your contacts to see like your avatar or the OMEMO public keys.
    * Other private data your XMPP client might upload like a list of conference bookmarks.
 * Offline messages, the archive (MAM) and files are stored for 90 days. We reserve the right to shorten this time span to 30 days in the future.

#### How we handle your data
 * We don’t sell your data in any way. And we never will.

This privacy policy page was created at [privacypolicytemplate.net](https://privacypolicytemplate.net) and modified/generated by [App Privacy Policy Generator](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.nisrulz.com/). In addition, content was used from the privacy policy of the Conversations.im Android app since that is the origin of the source code for this Ninja Chat app and therefore has very similar approaches to privacy.
