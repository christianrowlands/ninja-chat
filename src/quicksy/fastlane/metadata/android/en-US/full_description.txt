Quicksy is a spin off of the popular Jabber/XMPP client Conversations with automatic contact discovery.

You sign up with your phone number and Quicksy will automatically—based on the phone numbers in your address book—suggest possible contacts to you.

Under the hood Quicksy is a full-fledged Jabber client that lets you communicate with any user on any publicly federating server. Likewise users on Quicksy can be contacted from the outside simply by adding +phonenumber@quicksy.im to your contact list.

Aside from the contact sync the user interface is deliberately as close to Conversations as possible. This allows users to eventually migrate from Quicksy to Conversations without having to relearn how the app works.

Suggested contacts consists of other Quicksy users and regular Jabber/XMPP users who have entered their Jabber ID into the Quicksy Directory (https://quicksy.im/#get-listed).

NOTE: To enter (https://quicksy.im/enter/) your Jabber ID in the Quicksy
Directory an one time registration fee is required.
